PARTIONING booking table based on start_date
Partitioning a large table like booking is a great strategy to improve query performance. By splitting the table into smaller, more manageable pieces based on a key like start_date, the database can more efficiently scan only the relevant data partitions instead of the entire table.

Why is partitioning important?
Partitioning is a crucial database technique for managing and optimizing large tables. Its importance stems from how it changes the way a database handles data storage and retrieval.
-Improved Query Performance: the database doesn't have to scan the entire table to fulfill a query. Instead, it can quickly identify and access only the specific partitions that contain the relevant data.
-Simplified Data Management: Partitioning makes it easier to manage large datasets. You can perform maintenance tasks like backing up, archiving, or deleting old data by working on individual partitions.
-Enhanced Data Integrity: Since partitions are smaller, it's easier to maintain and rebuild indexes on them. This can improve data integrity and the speed of data modification operations.
-Optimized I/O Operations: By physically separating data into different files or storage locations, the database can reduce disk I/O contention. This can lead to more efficient parallel processing of queries, as multiple partitions can be accessed at the same time.
